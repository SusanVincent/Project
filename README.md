Feature Importance and Cluster Analysis for Predictive Accuracy on Wisconsin Breast Cancer data.



Various studies say that breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women, where abnormal growth of a mass of tissue, cause the expansion of malignant cells resulting in severe breast cancer. Early diagnosis can lead to a high survival rate. 
The diagnosis of breast cancer is traditionally done using histopathological analysis of the biopsied tissue. This process takes a lot of time, effort and requires a lot of specialized medical expertise. With the exponential growth in the performance of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence this process can be speed up to provide a lot of support 
to the medical practitioners in this field 

In this research a carefully curated dataset called “Wisconsin Breast Cancer” data is taken from UCI 
Machine Learning repository  Overall, this 
dataset has around 569 observations and 32 features with various attributes, represent multiple 
attributes of the tumour in patients. This dataset contains a target variable that has two classes –
benign and malignant.


Research Question
1. What are the most important features for classifying malignant tumours from benign tumours 
using Wisconsin breast cancer data? 
2. Can unsupervised learning algorithms be used to detect clusters among the data that have an 
association with breast cancer?
